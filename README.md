# Objective 1. Identify a two countries to compare.

| "High Aid" Country | Nigeria | 3.2B |
| "Low Aid" Country | Libya | 6.4 Million  |


# Objective 2. Analyze events occurring within each country to develop a hypothesis on the effect of aid.

## Aid Timeline

## Chosen Timeframe did you analyze and how did you pick that?

| Nigeria | 2007 | 2010 |
| Libya | 2007 | 2010 |

2011 is the most recent data point and a span of 5 years is an adequate enough amount of time to judge the effect of the aid on the country.


## "High Aid" Country

## "Low Aid" Country

### Differences

It seems like Nigeria's aid hasn't affected their GDP at all.


# Objective 3. Bring in other data sets to help you with your hypothesis.
