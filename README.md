# Objective 1. Identify a two countries to compare.

| "High Aid" Country | Nigeria | 3.2B |
| "Low Aid" Country | Libya | 6.4 Million  |


# Objective 2. Analyze events occurring within each country to develop a hypothesis on the effect of aid.

## Aid Timeline

## Chosen Timeframe did you analyze and how did you pick that?

| Nigeria | 2007 | 2010 |
| Libya | 2007 | 2010 |

2011 is the most recent data point and a span of 5 years is an adequate enough amount of time to judge the effect of the aid on the country.


## "High Aid" Country

### After Trends

### Differences

The GDP for Nigeria has actually declined in the years

## "Low Aid" Country

### Before Trends

### After Trends

### Differences

Libya's GDP has been extremely volatile and doesn't seem to be affected by their aid. This is probably due to the instability and violence enveloping the country. Nigeria's GDP growth started out high and has been steadily declining. 


# Objective 3. Bring in other data sets to help you with your hypothesis.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, foreign aid works very well with improving the health of developing countries, but it does not help improve economic growth.
