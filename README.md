# Objective 1. Identify a two countries to compare.

| "High Aid" Country | Haiti | 377000000 |
| "Low Aid" Country | United States | 231004 |


# Objective 2. Analyze events occurring within each country to develop a hypothesis on the effect of aid.

## Chosen Timeframe did you analyze and how did you pick that?

| Haiti | January 1st, 2010 | December 31st, 2010 |
| United States | October 31st, 2012 | November 31st, 2012 |

So we could download the least amount possible, we picked minimal data points, so we could download data in time.
