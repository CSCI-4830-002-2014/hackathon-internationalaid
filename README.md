# Objective 1. Identify a two countries to compare.

| "High Aid" Country | Cote D'Ivoire | 547,117,518.5987135 |
| "Low Aid" Country | Eritrea | 57,990,804.0259842 |


# Objective 2. Analyze events occurring within each country to develop a hypothesis on the effect of aid.

## Aid Timeline

2010 - 2011: Ivorian Crisis
In 2009, Ivory Coast received $2.2 Billion in aid, but 2010 saw a significant decline in aid, down to about $500 million. The Ivory Coast had its first election in 10 years, and after Alassane Ouattara lost the elction, he began his military offensive and took control of the country. Many citizens fled the country, specifically to Liberia.

As a result, between 2009 and 2010, Liberia saw a dramatic increase in aid to support Ivory Coast refugees. 

Liberia 2009: $363 million
Liberia 2010: $551 million

## Conclusions

More media coverage seems to be highly correlated with the amount of aid that countries receive. During 2009, Liberia received much greater amounts of aid money, coinciding with larger media coverage of the refugee influx frmo other countries.
