# Objective 1. Identify a two countries to compare.

| "High Aid" Country | Cote D'Ivoire | 547,117,518.5987135 |
| "Low Aid" Country | Eritrea | 57,990,804.0259842 |


# Objective 2. Analyze events occurring within each country to develop a hypothesis on the effect of aid.

## Aid Timeline

2010 - 2011: Ivorian Crisis
In 2009, Ivory Coast received $2.2 Billion in aid, but 2010 saw a significant decline in aid, down to about $500 million. The Ivory Coast had its first election in 10 years, and after Alassane Ouattara lost the elction, he began his military offensive and took control of the country. Many citizens fled the country, specifically to Liberia.

As a result, between 2009 and 2010, Liberia saw a dramatic increase in aid to support Ivory Coast refugees. 

Liberia 2009: $363 million
Liberia 2010: $551 million

## Chosen Timeframe did you analyze and how did you pick that?

| Eritrea | Jan 1, 2010 | Dec 31, 2010 |
| Ivory Coast | Jan 1, 2010 | Dec 31, 2010 |

We wanted to look at the data for an entire calender year for each country to get data from a large number of events.


## "High Aid" Country

### Differences

The two countries have very different needs when it comes to areas of international aid. The ivory coast has many funds allocated to debt forgiveness and teaching repsonsible spending, while Eritrea has lots of funds dedicated to disaster relief, being a violent country, and HIV/AIDS support which is a huge problem in this country.


# Objective 3. Bring in other data sets to help you with your hypothesis.

## Conclusions

More media coverage seems to be highly correlated with the amount of aid that countries receive. During 2009, Liberia received much greater amounts of aid money, coinciding with larger media coverage of the refugee influx frmo other countries.
