# Objective 1. Identify a two countries to compare.

| "High Aid" Country | Tanzania |  837 million (Annual 2009) |
| "Low Aid" Country | Nigeria | 339 million (Annual 2009) |


# Objective 2. Analyze events occurring within each country to develop a hypothesis on the effect of aid.

## Aid Timeline

## Chosen Timeframe did you analyze and how did you pick that?

| Tanzania |  2008 - March | 2010 - March |
| Nigeria | 2008 - March | 2010 - March |

It appears that 2009 had a large ratio of aid between these two countries - in figuring out the effectiveness of international aid on the stability of countries/other data we can get from the GDELT data, it seemed like a reasonable selection.

# Objective 3. Bring in other data sets to help you with your hypothesis.

1. We chose to compare Nigeria and Tansania based on the differences we were able to eliminate - they are both
	located in a similar area, face similar regional challanges, and are some of the larger countries in SSA. They
	have also both recently been members of UNSC. - See above for aid totals

2. The aid timeline looks like a bell-curve with a peak at 2009. We are not really sure the cause of this effect. it seems that it should be a much more flat distribution. Based on the fact that we picked end-dates instead of average annual disbursment amount, it could be that large agreements made previously by internation conventions happened to end around this time, and the "lower" parts of the bell curve are a better prediction for the average. 

3. We picked the timeframe from 2008-2010 based on the good ratio previously discussed for 2009. This ratio is important for evaluating the impact of high v low international aid.
